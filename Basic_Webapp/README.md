## Project Overview: AWS Full-Stack Web Application

This lab demonstrates how to build a **full-stack web application** using **AWS Amplify**, **AWS Lambda**, **AWS AppSync**, and **Amazon DynamoDB** — all fully managed, serverless services in the AWS ecosystem.

###  What is Built
- **Frontend:** A React-based web application hosted globally using the **AWS Amplify Console**.  
- **Authentication:** Integrated **Amplify Auth** to enable secure user sign-in and sign-out.  
- **Backend Functionality:** Implemented a **Lambda function** that triggers automatically when a user signs up.  
- **Database Integration:** Connected a **GraphQL API** (AppSync) with **DynamoDB** to store user data in real time.  

###  What This Demonstrates
- How frontend applications communicate securely with AWS backend services.  
- How **serverless functions** handle business logic and event triggers.  
- How **Amplify** automates CI/CD deployment pipelines for modern web apps.  
- How **DynamoDB** provides scalable, real-time data persistence.
- 
###  Services Used
- **AWS Amplify** – App hosting, authentication, and CI/CD.  
- **AWS AppSync** – GraphQL API integration between frontend and backend.  
- **AWS Lambda** – Serverless backend logic for user events.  
- **Amazon DynamoDB** – NoSQL database for storing user and app data.
